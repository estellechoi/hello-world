  Shortly after moving to San Francisco in October 2007, roommates and former
  <p></p>schoolmates Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia could not afford the rent for
  <p></p>their loft apartment. Chesky and Gebbia came up with the idea of putting
  <p></p> an air mattress in their
  <p></p>living room and turning it into a bed and breakfast.[5][6] The goal
  <p></p>at first was just "to make a few bucks".[7][8] In February 2008, Nathan
  <p></p>Blecharczyk, Chesky's former roommate, joined as the Chief Technology
  <p></p>Officer and the third co-founder of the new venture, which they named
  <p></p>AirBed & Breakfast.[6][9] They put together a website which offered
  <p></p>short-term living quarters, breakfast, and a unique business networking
  <p></p>opportunity for those who were unable to book a hotel in the saturated
  <p></p>market.[10] The site Airbedandbreakfast.com officially launched on August 11,
  <p></p> 2008.[11][12] The founders had their first customers in town in the
  <p></p>summer of 2008, during the Industrial Design Conference held by Industrial
  <p></p>Designers Society of America, where travelers had a hard time finding
  <p></p>lodging in the city.[6][13]
  <p></p>
  <p></p>To help fund the site, the founders created special edition breakfast
  <p></p>cereals, with presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain as
  <p></p>the inspiration for "Obama O's" and "Cap'n McCains".[14] In two months,
  <p></p>800 boxes of cereal were sold at $40 each, which generated more than
  <p></p> $30,000 for the company's incubation.[15][16] It also got the company
  <p></p>noticed by computer programmer Paul Graham, who invited the founders
  <p></p>to the January 2009 winter training session of his startup incubator, Y
  <p></p>Combinator, which provided them with training and $20,000 in funding in
  <p></p>exchange for a small interest in the company.[7][17][18] With the website
  <p></p> already built, they used the $20,000 Y-Combinator investment to fly to
  <p></p>New York City to meet users and promote the site.[19]
  <p></p>They returned to San Francisco with a profitable business model to present
  <p></p>to West Coast investors. By March 2009, the site had 10,000 users
  <p></p>and 2,500 listings.[18]
  <p></p>
  <p></p>In March 2009, the name of the company was shortened to Airbnb.com,
  <p></p> and the site's content had expanded from air beds and shared spaces
  <p></p>to a variety of properties including entire homes and apartments,
  <p></p> private rooms, castles, boats, manors, tree houses, tipis, igloos,
  <p></p> private islands and other properties.[20]
  <p></p>
  <p></p> One year later, there were 15 people working from Chesky and Gebbia's
  <p></p>loft apartment on Rausch Street in San Francisco. To make room for employees,
  <p></p> Brian Chesky gave up his bedroom and lived at lodging booked via the Airbnb
  <p></p>service until the company moved into its first office space.[21][7]
  <p></p>In April 2009, the company received $600,000 in seed money from Sequoia
  <p></p>Capital[7] and, in November 2010, raised $7.2 million in financing from
  <p></p>Greylock Partners and, again, from Sequoia Capital, in a Series A round,
  <p></p>then announcing that out of 700,000 nights booked, 80% had occurred
  <p></p>in the previous six months.[22]
  <p></p>
  <p></p> In February 2011, Airbnb announced its 1,000,000th night booked.[23][24]
  <p></p> In January 2012, the company announced its 5,000,000th night booked.[25]
  <p></p>In June 2012, Airbnb announced its 10,000,000th night booked, doubling
  <p></p>business in the previous five months.[26][27] Of these bookings,
  <p></p>75% of the business came from markets outside of the continental United States.
  <p></p>
  <p></p> In mid-2011, Airbnb began offering US$50,000 of secondary insurance,
  <p></p>called its "host guarantee", which covers property damage due to vandalism
  <p></p>and theft. In May 2012, the company increased the amount to US$1,000,000.[28]
  <p></p>
  <p></p> On May 9, 2011, Airbnb added a feature called "Social Connections"
  <p></p>that allows users to see if they have common friends with hosts or guests
  <p></p>via Facebook.[29][30]
  <p></p>
  <p></p> On May 25, 2011, Ashton Kutcher, an actor and partner at A-Grade
  <p></p>Investments, announced a significant investment in the company and
  <p></p>his role as a strategic brand advisor for the company.[31]
  <p></p>
  <p></p>At the 2011 South by Southwest conference, Airbnb won the "app" award.[32]
  <p></p>
  <p></p> In October 2011, Airbnb established an office in London, its second international office.[33][34]
  <p></p>
  <p></p>Due to the growth of international end-users, in early 2012,
  <p></p>Airbnb opened offices in Paris, Milan, Barcelona, Copenhagen, Moscow, and
  <p></p>São Paulo.[25] These openings were in addition to existing offices
  <p></p> in San Francisco, London, Hamburg, and Berlin.[35]
  <p></p>In September 2013, the company announced that it would establish its
  <p></p>European headquarters in Dublin.[36][37]
  <p></p>
  <p></p>In November 2012, Airbnb opened an office in Sydney, Australia,
  <p></p>its 11th office location, and announced plans to launch the service
  <p></p>in Thailand and Indonesia.[38][39] In December 2012, Airbnb announced
  <p></p>its strategy to move more aggressively into the Asian market
  <p></p> with the launch of an office in Singapore.
